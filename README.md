# Interactive Handshake Collector Script in C

<br>

## QUESTION: 

## Why in C? Why not just use bash, especially because you don't even use linux api?!

<br>
<br>

## ANSWER: 

## Because i like C and wanted to use C, it's not about efficiency, especially because i call bash, i could have done the same just in bash, but it's not as much fun. I used this project to get used to some basic functions in C.
